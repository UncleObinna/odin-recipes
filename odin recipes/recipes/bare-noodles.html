    <p>
      Noodles can also be eaten bare, without the Nigerian Jollof flavour. This
      dish is for those days you do not have the desire to whip up something
      that might take a while. In 10 mins, it is ready. It is best enjoyed with
      boiled egg, chicken or turkey and your favourite cold beverage.
